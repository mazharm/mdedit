# App Icons

Before deploying your Teams app, you need to create two icon files:

## Required Icons

1. **color.png** (192x192 pixels)
   - Full-color app icon
   - Used in the Teams app store and sidebar
   - Should have a transparent background

2. **outline.png** (32x32 pixels)
   - Monochrome outline icon (white lines only)
   - Used in the Teams activity bar and other compact UI
   - Must be pure white (#FFFFFF) on transparent background

## Creating Icons

You can use any image editor (Figma, Photoshop, etc.) to create these icons.

A simple MDEdit logo could be:
- A stylized "MD" text
- A document icon with markdown syntax
- A split-screen editor icon

Place the icon files in this directory alongside manifest.json.
